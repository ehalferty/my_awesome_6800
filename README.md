# my_awesome_6800
A CPU in Verilog which can run Motorola MC6800 instructions

**Status:** Noticed that some instructions are specified in the MC6800 documentation one way, but various MC6800 simulators simulate them another way. Currently building a simple MC6800 computer to test the instructions on real hardware and verify their behavior.
